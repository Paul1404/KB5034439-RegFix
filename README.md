* Windows operating system
* Administrative privileges are required to run these tools, as they modify the Windows Registry.

## Quick Start with PowerShell One-Liner üöÄ

For users who are familiar with our repository and have verified its security, we provide a convenient PowerShell one-liner method to directly execute the script. This approach allows you to quickly run the script without manually downloading it.

### How to Use the PowerShell One-Liner

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**: This script requires administrative privileges. Right-click on the PowerShell icon and choose "Run as Administrator".
    
2. **Execute the Script**: Copy and paste the following command into your PowerShell terminal:
    
    ```powershell
    irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Paul1404/KB5034439-RegFix/main/AddRegistryKey.ps1 | iex
    ```
    

### Important Security Notice ‚ö†Ô∏è

* **Verify the Repository**: Before executing the one-liner, ensure that you are accessing the correct and trusted GitHub repository. Only run scripts that come from sources you trust.
    
* **Review the Script**: Although you trust the source, it's a good practice to review the contents of any script before executing it to understand the changes it will make.
    
* **Execution Policy**: Your system's PowerShell execution policy may prevent the script from running. You can check your current policy with `Get-ExecutionPolicy` and change it if necessary using `Set-ExecutionPolicy`, for example, `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`. Please be aware that changing the execution policy should be done with a thorough understanding of the security implications.
    

This method is designed for ease of use and efficiency but always prioritize the security of your systems when executing scripts.
